     <h1>Module 1: Introduction to Accessibility</h1>
    </div>

<h2>Why Accesibility Matters</h2>
<p>Learning should be for everyone. Accessibility ensures that people of all abilities—including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive differences—can access, navigate, and benefit from educational content. It’s not just about compliance—it’s about compassion, equity, and empowerment.</p>
<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
<p>By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
    <ul>
        <li>Define what accessibility means in digital learning contexts.</li>
        <li>Identify the common barriers that learners face.</li> 
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Understanding Accessibility in Digital Learning</h2>

<p>Accessibility in digital learning means designing content, platforms, and experiences that are usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities.
It goes beyond compliance checklists—true accessibility is about removing barriers so all learners can access content <strong>equitably,</strong><strong>effectively,</strong> and <strong>comfortably</strong>. It ensures that a screen reader can describe what a sighted person sees, that a keyboard can substitute for a mouse, and that no one is excluded based on how they learn or interact with information.
Digital accessibility is the foundation for inclusive learning. It doesn’t only benefit those with permanent disabilities—it also supports:
<ul>
    <li>Temporary challenges (e.g., broken wrist)</li>
    <li>Sitauation limitations (e.g., noisy environments)</li>
    <li>Aging users</li>
    <li>Neurodivergent learners</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Common Barriers Learners Face</h2>
<div class="Think">
<icon><img src="graphics/person.png" alt="person thinking icon" width="15%" height="15%"></icon> 
<p>You are a person with visual impairment and you are reviewing a course module that includes a pie chart. Your <dfn title="An assistive device used by persons with visual impairment">screen reader</dfn> encounters this chart and simply announces: 'Image.' What will you do?
    <br><i>What is the barrier here?</i>
     </p>
</div>     
<p>Despite the best intentions, digital experiences often fall short for many learners. Here's what that can look like in practice.<br>

        <li>Interactive elements that require mouse use</li>
        <li>Small or poorly placed clickable targets</li>

<h2>Why This Matters?</h2>
<p>When these barriers go unaddressed, learners can’t fully engage, complete tasks, or feel confident in their learning environment. Accessibility invites everyone to the table—not just to sit, but to thrive.</p>
